# Server-and-Client-WiFi-Communication-using-Arduino-Boards
The idea is to create a server and a client using Arduino Boards. Data will be communicated as a string message. Server requests data from client and in response client sends the requested data to the server via WiFi. Then, server processes data and responds to client accordingly after performing some analysis.
